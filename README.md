## Features
### Users
- **Learning new words:** Users can learn new English words in the "Lesson" tab.
- **Repetition of words:** Users can review words using the 'SuperMem' algorithm to help with memorization.
- **Score:** For each correct given words, user earn points depends on word's cerf level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)
- **Ranking:** Users can compete with each other and view the top 20 users, as well as their own position on the list.
- **Podium:** The top three users will be featured on the podium.
- **Sending Daily Statistic:** Every day at 12PM, users will receive an email with their daily statistic.
- **User Forget Me:** Users can request to be forgotten. When they do, their data will be deleted, and their JWT token will be added to a blacklist in Redis. Additionally, their email (hashed) will be stored in the **blacklisted users table**, ensuring they cannot be re-registered with the same email.
### Admin
- **Words:** As an admin I can add, edit and delete words from the admin panel.
- **Users**  As an admin I can manage user data and ban users from the admin panel.

## Microservices Roles
### User-Service
Responsibility for services related to user data, such as adding, changing data and deleting information. It also handles issuing JWT tokens based on the RS256 algorithm, which is asymmetric, utilizing both public and private keys. Other microservices can independently verify the tokens using the public key without needing to communicate with the user-service.
### Word-Service
Responsibility for handling all word-related operations, including creating, updating, and deleting words. It also generates personalized lessons using the SuperMem spaced repetition algorithm.
As part of its responsibilities, Word-Service creates review word sets for users, based on the review dates scheduled by SuperMem.
